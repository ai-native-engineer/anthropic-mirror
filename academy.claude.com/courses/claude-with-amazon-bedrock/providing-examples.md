# Providing examples

Lesson 207 min

Providing examples in your prompts is one of the most effective prompt engineering techniques you'll use. This approach, known as "one-shot" or "multi-shot" prompting, involves giving Claude sample input/output pairs to guide its responses.

## How Examples Work[](#how-examples-work)

Let's look at a sentiment analysis example. Say you want Claude to categorize whether a tweet is positive or negative:

The challenge here is sarcasm. A tweet like "Yeah, sure, that was the best movie I've seen since 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'" appears positive on the surface, but it's actually sarcastic and negative (Plan 9 from Outer Space is famously terrible).

## Adding Examples to Your Prompt[](#adding-examples-to-your-prompt)

To handle this, you can add examples that show Claude exactly how to respond:

The key elements are:

* Clear introduction: "Here is a example input with an ideal response"
* XML tags for structure: `<sample_input>` and `<ideal_output>`
* Concrete examples that demonstrate the desired behavior

## Handling Corner Cases[](#handling-corner-cases)

For tricky scenarios like sarcasm, you can provide multiple examples (multi-shot prompting). Add context to highlight what Claude should watch for:

```
Be especially careful with tweets that contain sarcasm.
For example:
<sample_input>
Oh yeah, I really needed a flight delay tonight! Excellent!
</sample_input>
<ideal_output>
Negative
</ideal_output>
```

## When to Use Examples[](#when-to-use-examples)

Examples are particularly useful for:

* Capturing corner cases or edge scenarios
* Defining complex output formats (like specific JSON structures)
* Showing Claude exactly what "good" output looks like

## Finding Good Examples from Evaluations[](#finding-good-examples-from-evaluations)

When running prompt evaluations, look for your highest-scoring outputs in the HTML report. These make excellent examples to include in your prompt.

![](https://academy.claude.com/assets/media/fd159d6bcdc25f88c8a4617225a19ac38d830f70042fd53f7aa8236ec416042b.png)

Find a response that scored well (ideally a 10, or your highest score), then copy both the input and output to use as your example.

## Adding Context to Examples[](#adding-context-to-examples)

You can make examples even more effective by explaining why they're good. After your example output, add a brief explanation:

```
<ideal_output>
[Your example output here]
</ideal_output>

This example meal plan is well-structured, provides detailed information on food choices and quantities, and aligns with the athlete's goals and restrictions.
```

This helps Claude understand not just what to produce, but why that output is considered ideal.

## Best Practices[](#best-practices)

* **Use XML tags** to clearly structure your examples
* **Be explicit** about what you're showing Claude
* **Choose representative examples** that cover your most important use cases
* **Include corner cases** that might trip up the model
* **Explain why examples are good** when it's not obvious

One-shot and multi-shot prompting will quickly become essential tools in your prompt engineering toolkit, especially when you need consistent, well-formatted outputs or want to handle tricky edge cases reliably.
