# Hooks as approval gates

Lesson 117 min

The build phase used hooks as guardrails, allowing or blocking actions with no human involved (**Stage 3: Build**). A hook can also ask, pausing the action until the person running the session confirms it. When the approver is someone else, such as a release manager, the hook looks for their recorded approval and blocks until it exists.

The play sits in **Stage 5: Deploy** because the release gate is the clearest case, but hooks are not deploy-specific: they run wherever Claude acts. For example, hooks can block edits to migrations and infra without a change ticket during **Stage 3: Build**, and stop the agent editing test files during a fix task in **Stage 4: Test**.

## Getting started[](#getting-started)

* **Prerequisites**: None.
* **Infrastructure**: A written list of the approvals the change process requires.

## How to execute it[](#how-to-execute-it)

1. Engineering leadership, with change management and compliance, lists the human approval gates that must survive, such as change management sign-off, release authorization, and edits to protected paths.
2. The platform engineer expresses each gate as a hook, a script that runs before Claude acts that can allow, ask, or block.
3. Team hooks go in `.claude/settings.json` in Git, and non-negotiable hooks go in managed settings owned by the platform or IT admin, where individual engineers cannot switch them off.
4. A block should explain itself, so when a hook stops an action, the reason and the route to approval appear in Claude's output.

## What it looks like[](#what-it-looks-like)

This example is an insurer's customer portal, released to dev, staging, and production. Deployment runs through MCP tools, one server per environment, and each server has a `release` tool.

The entry below is a standalone example in the project's `.claude/settings.json`. Its matcher catches `release` on every server. The empty `args` list makes Claude Code run the script directly instead of through a shell:

json

```
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__deploy-.*__release",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/release-gate.sh",
            "args": [] }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The gate itself, `.claude/hooks/release-gate.sh`:

bash

```
#!/bin/bash
# Release gate. dev: allow. staging: ask. production: an approved change ticket for this version, or block.
input=$(cat)
tool=$(jq -r '.tool_name' <<<"$input")
version=$(jq -r '.tool_input.version' <<<"$input")
ticket=$(jq -r '.tool_input.ticket // empty' <<<"$input")

decide() {   # decide <allow|ask|deny> <reason>
  jq -n --arg decision "$1" --arg reason "$2" '{hookSpecificOutput: {
    hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
    permissionDecision: $decision,
    permissionDecisionReason: $reason}}'
  exit 0
}

case "$tool" in
  mcp__deploy-dev__release)
    decide allow "dev needs no approval" ;;
  mcp__deploy-staging__release)
    [ "$GITHUB_REF" = "refs/heads/main" ] && decide allow "pipeline release from main"
    decide ask "This ships $version to staging. Approve only if you own this release." ;;
  mcp__deploy-prod__release)
    route="Open a change ticket at https://change.example.com/new for version $version, \
wait for the release manager to approve it, then call release again with that ticket number."
    [[ "$ticket" =~ ^CHG-[0-9]+$ && "$version" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$ ]] ||
      decide deny "Production needs an approved change ticket. $route"
    if approver=$(/usr/local/bin/change-ticket show --ticket "$ticket" --format json |
        jq -er --arg v "$version" 'select(.state == "approved" and .version == $v) | .approver' 2>/dev/null); then
      decide allow "$ticket approved by $approver"
    fi
    decide deny "$ticket is not approved for version $version. $route" ;;
  *)
    decide deny "No release rule for $tool. Add one to release-gate.sh first." ;;
esac
```

In the script, `version` and `ticket` are the inputs Claude passes to the `release` tool. `change-ticket` stands for your change system's own command-line tool. The gate depends on the agent having no way to write to the records it reads.

In a non-interactive run nobody can answer an `ask`, so Claude Code denies the call. That is why the gate allows staging from the pipeline on `main`, where the approved merge is the approval.

The gate has a limit. An engineer could set `GITHUB_REF` by hand in their own session, although doing that skips only the prompt they would have answered themselves.

The reason on an `ask` is shown to the person. The reason on a `deny` is shown to Claude, so the block message names the route to approval for Claude to pass on. The staging result comes first, then production with no ticket:

json

```
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "ask",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "This ships 4f2c9e1 to staging. Approve only if you own this release."
  }
}
```

json

```
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "deny",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "Production needs an approved change ticket. Open a change ticket at https://change.example.com/new for version 4f2c9e1, wait for the release manager to approve it, then call release again with that ticket number."
  }
}
```

## Governance considerations[](#governance-considerations)

Hooks are the approval gates. The gate condition is enforced every time, for everyone. Allow and block decisions are logged with a timestamp. The gate also defines what counts as approval, whether that's an approved change ticket or the release manager's sign-off.

## Managed settings for a regulated enterprise[](#managed-settings-for-a-regulated-enterprise)

Managed settings for a regulated enterprise, deployed by the platform team via mobile device management (MDM) or the admin console. Engineers cannot edit or override any of the settings therein. See below:

json

```
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(.env*)", "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "WebFetch", "Bash(curl *)", "Bash(wget *)"
    ],
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git *)", "Bash(make build)",
      "Bash(make test)", "Bash(make lint)"
    ],
    "disableBypassPermissionsMode": "disable"
  },
  "allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly": true,
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "failIfUnavailable": true,
    "allowUnsandboxedCommands": false,
    "network": { "allowedDomains": ["git.internal.example.com", "registry.npmjs.org"] },
    "credentials": {
      "files": [
        { "path": "~/.ssh", "mode": "deny" },
        { "path": "~/.aws/credentials", "mode": "deny" }
      ],
      "envVars": [ { "name": "GITHUB_TOKEN", "mode": "deny" } ]
    }
  },
  "allowManagedHooksOnly": true,
  "disableSideloadFlags": true,
  "allowManagedMcpServersOnly": true,
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "example-corp/approved-plugins" }
  ],
  "requiredMinimumVersion": "2.1.193"
}
```

**What the settings do, in control terms:**

* `permissions.deny` keeps secrets out of the agent's context and blocks arbitrary network egress through tools. `permissions.allow` pre-approves the safe inner loop so the deny list doesn't turn into prompt fatigue.
* `disableBypassPermissionsMode` plus `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` means no engineer, project file, or command-line flag can widen the rules.
* `sandbox` covers what permissions cannot. A tool-level deny on WebFetch doesn't stop a shell command reaching the network, whereas the OS-level domain allowlist blocks egress outright, so the two enforce one objective at different layers. `failIfUnavailable` and `allowUnsandboxedCommands` turn the sandbox into a precondition, meaning Claude Code refuses to start when the sandbox cannot initialize and a command that fails inside the sandbox cannot be retried outside it.
* `credentials` handles a case the deny rules miss. `permissions.deny` governs Claude's file tools, but a sandboxed shell command could still read `~/.ssh` or `~/.aws/credentials` by default. This block denies those reads and strips the listed secrets from the environment of sandboxed commands.
* `allowManagedHooksOnly` means only hooks defined in managed settings run; hooks in user, project, and local settings are blocked, including the standalone `.claude/settings.json` example above. To keep this play's approval gate enforced, define it in the managed file's own `hooks` block.
* `disableSideloadFlags` and `strictKnownMarketplaces` mean that any skill, agent, hook, or MCP server on an engineer's machine came through the organization's approved plugin marketplace and not from a home directory. The marketplace allowlist controls what can be installed, and the flags that would sideload a plugin, agent, or MCP config for a single run are rejected at startup.
* `allowManagedMcpServersOnly` makes the agent's tool surface an allowlist owned by the platform team.
* `requiredMinimumVersion` refuses to start on a version below the approved floor, so the controls are enforced by a build the organization has actually assessed.

Treat the example as a starting point to customize to your own environment. Each deny rule removes some capability, and the right balance depends on the data classification of the repo. The [settings reference(opens in new tab)](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) documents all keys, including the managed-only ones.

## How to measure it[](#how-to-measure-it)

For the hooks themselves:

* **Leading indicator**: Time spent waiting on each approval gate. Every hook decision is written to the OpenTelemetry export with a timestamp and an allow or block verdict, so the wait is visible per gate.
* **Lagging indicator**: Gate violations reaching production before and after hooks, from the incident tracker.
