Claude for M365 does its work inside your Office app. When a file has very
large ranges, many shapes, or heavy formulas, the app can slow down or stop
responding.[[1]](#cite-note-1) This happens with any heavy task in Office, with
or without Claude.

##  Office runs one step at a time

Claude sends each step to Office and waits for Office to finish it. While
Office is busy, other actions can stall too.[[1]](#cite-note-1)
![Claude sends a step and waits. Office runs the step, for example a recalculation, a large read, or a big slide edit. At the wait limit, Claude reports a timeout, but Office is still running the step. The wait limit is 90 seconds for steps where Claude runs code, 5 minutes for other steps, and 2 minutes on the web. Stop and a timeout end Claude's wait, not the step Office already started.](https://mintcdn.com/claude-ai/_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH/images/office-agents/performance/perf-one-step.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH&q=85&s=86e807e77450672873ddcbd4e16578d3)
Four habits reduce slowdowns.

* **Let each step finish**: do not click, type, edit, run macros, or start a
  data refresh while Claude works. If a refresh is already running, wait for
  it or stop it with Esc or Stop Refresh.[[2]](#cite-note-2) If Office asks whether to
  keep running the add-in, continue.[[3]](#cite-note-3)
* **Give Claude only what the task needs**: name the sheet and range, or
  copy the sheets you need into a new workbook.
* **Ask for large changes one step at a time**: split a big job into
  smaller requests.
* **Wait after a timeout**: let Office respond, save, then ask for a
  smaller step.

##  Limits to know

These limits come from Claude for M365 and from Office itself.

| Limit | Value | What it means for you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wait for a step where Claude runs code | 90 seconds | A heavy step can time out |
| Wait for other steps, such as writing cells | 5 minutes on the desktop, 2 minutes on the web | A heavy step can time out |
| Wait for a Word text edit | 30 seconds | A heavy edit can time out |
| Cells returned by one Claude read in Excel | 2,000 cells with data | Claude reads a large sheet in several steps |
| Cells Office reads from one range | 5,000,000[[3]](#cite-note-3) | A larger read can fail |
| One request in Excel on the web | 5 MB[[3]](#cite-note-3) | Large reads and writes can fail on the web |
| Command batches waiting in Office | 50[[4]](#cite-note-4) | More batches cause errors |
| Workbook opened in a browser | Up to 100 MB, depending on your subscription[[5]](#cite-note-5) | Open larger files in Excel on the desktop |
| Memory for 32-bit Excel | Up to 4 GB on 64-bit Windows[[6]](#cite-note-6) | Use 64-bit Office for large workbooks |

##  File size and risk

Sessions with larger files more often end with a step that never finished.
This is how Claude for M365 detects an Office crash, a force quit, or a
reload. Larger files also mean longer sessions. The chart is directional,
based on what Claude for M365 usage shows.
![Directional chart of risk by file size. In Excel, measured by total used cells across all sheets, risk is lowest under 1 million cells, higher from 1 to 5 million, and highest over 5 million. In PowerPoint, measured by slides, risk is lowest under 100 slides, higher from 100 to 199, and highest at 200 or more. The chart shows direction, not measured values.](https://mintcdn.com/claude-ai/_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH/images/office-agents/performance/perf-risk.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH&q=85&s=c018954e584a7b8fe3712b69b226f106)
The risk rises steadily, without a sharp threshold. Treat the bands as guides.

| File | Works well | Higher risk, so narrow your requests | Use at your own risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Excel, total used cells across all sheets | Under 1 million | 1 to 5 million | Over 5 million |
| PowerPoint, slides | Under 100 | 100 to 199 | 200 or more |

To estimate the total for a workbook, go to each sheet and press Ctrl+End to
move to its last cell.[[7]](#cite-note-7) Multiply the number of the last row by the
number of the last column, then add the results for all sheets. A last cell
of Z100000 is column 26 and row 100,000, about 2.6 million cells. Formatting
on empty cells moves the last cell, so a sheet can count as larger than its
data.[[7]](#cite-note-7)
A single sheet above 5 million cells also passes the limit for one Office
read.[[3]](#cite-note-3)

##  Limit what is open at once

Workbooks that you open in the same instance of Excel share one Excel
process, and each workbook has its own Claude pane.[[8]](#cite-note-8) Every pane
sends its commands to that process. Office queues the command batches it
receives, up to 50 at a time.[[4]](#cite-note-4) When the computer is short of CPU
or memory, the wait grows, and Excel can stall or crash.
![One Excel process contains three workbooks, each with its own Claude pane. The commands from all three panes go into a single command queue in the same process. The process runs on a computer with limited CPU and memory. When CPU and memory run short, waits grow and Excel can stall or crash. Keep only the files you need open.](https://mintcdn.com/claude-ai/_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH/images/office-agents/performance/perf-shared-process.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH&q=85&s=524e1317ae5b08f66fe51b4dcf8373ae)
Other Office apps run in their own processes, but they share the same CPU and
memory. Office starts to monitor add-in memory when the device passes 80%
memory use.[[3]](#cite-note-3)

* Close the files you are not working in.
* For large files, work in one file at a time.
* When Claude works across Office apps, ask it to finish in one app before it
  moves to the next. See [Work across M365 apps](https://claude.com/docs/office-agents/work-across-apps).
* If Excel runs out of memory with several workbooks open, open Excel in a new
  instance.[[8]](#cite-note-8)

##  Lighter files respond faster

A smaller used range and lighter formulas shorten the time Office needs for
each step.

###  Make large workbooks lighter

Excel has built-in tools that show what makes a workbook heavy.

| Task | Where in Excel |
| --- | --- |
| See counts of cells, formulas, and objects | Review, Workbook Statistics[[9]](#cite-note-9) |
| Remove formatting from empty cells | Review, Check Performance[[10]](#cite-note-10) |
| Find hidden shapes and pictures | Home, Find & Select, Selection Pane[[11]](#cite-note-11) |

Save a copy of the workbook before you run Check Performance. It removes
formatting from cells that look empty, including cells used for pixel
art.[[10]](#cite-note-10)
If the workbook is still too large, copy the sheets you need into a new
workbook.[[11]](#cite-note-11)

###  Ask for formulas that calculate fast

Some formulas make Excel recalculate far more cells than others. Ask Claude
for these forms.

* **Conditional sums and counts**: SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and AVERAGEIFS. They
  calculate much faster than array formulas.[[12]](#cite-note-12)
* **Today’s date**: TODAY in one cell, with other cells that refer to
  it.[[11]](#cite-note-11)
* **Direct references**: cell references in place of OFFSET and INDIRECT,
  which recalculate at each recalculation.[[13]](#cite-note-13)

###  Pause calculation during large changes

Excel recalculates dependent formulas after every change. For large formula
changes, pause recalculation until Claude is done.

1

Set calculation to manual

On the Formulas tab, select Calculation Options, Manual.[[14]](#cite-note-14)
The option Automatic except for Data Tables skips only data tables.
Ordinary formulas still recalculate after every change.

2

Ask Claude for the changes

Claude writes the formulas without a recalculation after each one.

3

Recalculate

Press F9 when Claude is done. In Manual mode, formula results stay out of
date until you press F9.

4

Check the results

Ask Claude to verify the formulas after the recalculation.

5

Turn automatic calculation back on

Select Calculation Options, Automatic.

Manual calculation applies to every open workbook in Excel on the desktop.[[15]](#cite-note-15)
In Excel on the web it applies only to the current workbook. In Manual mode,
saving can recalculate the workbook.[[14]](#cite-note-14)

###  Make large presentations lighter

Large pictures and media make a presentation larger.[[16]](#cite-note-16) Compress them
before you ask Claude for large changes.

| Task | Where in PowerPoint |
| --- | --- |
| Compress pictures | Picture Format, Compress Pictures, with “Apply only to this picture” cleared[[16]](#cite-note-16) |
| Compress audio and video | File, Info, Compress Media, in PowerPoint on Windows[[17]](#cite-note-17) |

Save a copy of the presentation before you compress. Deleting cropped picture
areas and discarding editing data cannot be undone.[[16]](#cite-note-16)
Ask Claude to change a few slides at a time.

##  When Office stops responding

Use this table when Office stops responding during a request.

| Situation | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Claude waits on a step | Wait. Do not click repeatedly. |
| Claude reports a timeout | Wait until Office responds, save, then ask for a smaller step. The step can still be running in Office. |
| Office closes | Reopen the file and look for the Document Recovery pane.[[18]](#cite-note-18) Start a new chat with a smaller request. |
| It happens often | Send your IT admin the transcript and the time of the problem. |

When something goes wrong, keep your work and the chat for your admin.

1

Recover your work

Reopen the app and look for the Document Recovery pane.[[18]](#cite-note-18)
In Excel, you can also go to File, Info, Manage Document, Recover Unsaved
Workbooks.[[19]](#cite-note-19)

2

Download the chat

In the Claude pane, select More options, then Download Transcript.

3

Send it to IT

Send the file and the time of the problem through your usual support
channel. The file contains your chat.

##  Investigate a crash or hang

Windows, Office, and Claude each keep a record of what happened. Start with
the time of the problem, then check the records below in order. The Windows
and Office records exist on Windows only.
![Four sources of records, in order. First, the user: the time of the problem, which is the key to every record, and the transcript of what Claude was doing. Second, Windows only: Reliability Monitor with a daily crash and hang timeline, Event Viewer with event 1000 for a crash and 1002 for a hang, and Windows Error Reporting files for crashes and hangs. Third, Office: the Telemetry Log with add-in CPU and error events, which stays off until an admin enables it. Fourth, your collector: an OpenTelemetry trace for every user turn.](https://mintcdn.com/claude-ai/_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH/images/office-agents/performance/perf-where-to-look.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=_Xjykq_jOPUQ7vjH&q=85&s=d62ef0be87cdd199fb375df256ef2642)

###  Collect the user’s report

The time of the problem is the key to every other record. Ask the user for
the time, the Office app, and whether Office closed or stopped responding.
Then ask the user to select More options in the Claude pane, then Download
Transcript. The transcript shows what Claude was doing when the problem
started.

###  Check Reliability Monitor

Reliability Monitor shows a daily timeline of app crashes and hangs. Use it
to confirm that the problem happened and to see how often it repeats.
Press Windows+R and run this command.[[20]](#cite-note-20)

```
perfmon /rel
```

###  Read Event Viewer

Event Viewer separates a crash from a hang. Open Event Viewer, select
Windows Logs, then Application. Look for events from `EXCEL.EXE`,
`POWERPNT.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `OUTLOOK.EXE` near the time of the
problem.

* **Event 1000**: a crash. The event names the faulting module.[[21]](#cite-note-21)
* **Event 1002**: a hang.[[22]](#cite-note-22)

###  Find Windows Error Reporting files

Windows Error Reporting keeps a report for each crash or hang. The reports
are in one of two folders.[[23]](#cite-note-23)
The folder for the signed-in user:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive
```

The folder for the whole machine:

```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive
```

###  Check the Office Telemetry Log

The Office Telemetry Log can list add-in CPU and runtime error
events.[[24]](#cite-note-24) It records events only after you turn on the
`EnableLogging` policy.[[25]](#cite-note-25) Microsoft no longer supports the
Office Telemetry Dashboard but keeps the log.[[26]](#cite-note-26)
After you turn on the policy, open this folder:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry
```

###  Search your OpenTelemetry collector

Claude sends one trace for every user turn, including steps that failed.
Search your collector for traces at the time of the problem. See
[Configure a custom OpenTelemetry collector](https://claude.com/docs/office-agents/opentelemetry).
