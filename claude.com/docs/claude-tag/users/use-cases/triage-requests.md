##  How triage prompts work

This page is for any team with an intake channel, like #ask-it, #design-requests, or #legal-help, where people post questions and someone has to route or answer each one.
The two prompts below are Slack messages you paste in the request channel, in order. Together they set up a standing role: when someone tags `@Claude` on their request, it replies in-thread, answering what it can, flagging duplicates, and routing the rest. The weekly rollup lands as a top-level post in the same channel and sweeps anything that wasn’t tagged.

##  Check the channel’s connections

Check that the channel has the connections below. Ask `@Claude what can you access from this channel?` to check; an admin can [add a connection](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/add-connections) the channel is missing.

| Connection | Examples | Why it matters here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | — | Works on Slack content alone |
| Knowledge and docs | Google Drive, Notion | Optional. Reads a [runbook](#give-claude-a-runbook-of-standing-answers) or past decisions the team keeps in a doc |
| Issue tracking | Linear, Jira | Optional. Files routed items as tickets |

##  Prompts to paste

Add Claude to the channel with `/invite @Claude` if it isn’t there, then two messages set it up.

1

Give the channel a standing role

```
@Claude remember for this channel: when someone tags you on a request, check whether it duplicates something already reported, answer it directly if the answer exists, and otherwise route it to the right owner with a one-line summary. Track recurring themes.
```

“Remember for this channel” saves the role to [channel memory](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/memory), so it applies to everyone’s threads, not just yours. Tell requesters to include `@Claude` when they post; pin the convention or add it to the channel topic.

2

Add a weekly rollup so nothing is missed

```
@Claude every Friday at 3pm, post a summary of this week's requests: how many, top themes, and anything still unrouted, including posts that didn't tag you.
```

“Including posts that didn’t tag you” turns the recap into a sweep, so requests that arrived without a mention are still caught. To list or cancel scheduled work later, see [Manage standing work](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/proactivity#manage-standing-work).

Answers draw on what the channel has already settled, meaning its [memory](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/memory) and its own past threads, and routing gets more accurate as corrections land in channel memory.

##  Hand a request to the team that owns it

When a request belongs to another team, fork its thread into that team’s channel from inside the thread. Claude starts a new thread there with the request as background and leaves a link in the original thread, so the requester can follow the work without being re-asked for details.

```
@Claude !fork #payments-eng take this request: the reporter needs refunds on partial orders, and their screenshots and the duplicate check are in the linked thread.
```

The channel you name must be public, with both you and Claude in it. See [Fork a thread](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/commands#fork-a-thread) for the other rules.

##  Give Claude a runbook of standing answers

When people keep posting the same questions in a channel, give Claude the team’s settled answers instead of leaving it to derive an answer from the channel’s history each time. A runbook is the team’s own document of those answers, kept in whatever form the team already uses, such as a Google Doc. It can say which requests have a standard answer, which route to an owner, and which the team answers itself.
To have Claude answer from the runbook, put the standing guidance in the **Channel instructions** field on the channel’s [Configure page](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/good-habits#configure-claude-for-a-channel). The field needs no connection, and a short runbook can go in it whole. Claude [reads a channel’s untagged messages and replies to some of them on its own](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/when-claude-responds), so name the cases to leave alone as explicitly as the answers.
For a runbook kept as a document, Claude can read it when an admin has [connected the app that holds it](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/add-connections) and the connection’s account can see the document. The instruction then points at the document:

```
Answer requests in this channel from the team's triage runbook: <link to the runbook doc>. Read it before answering. If a request isn't covered there, mention <your on-call person's handle> so they can pick it up.
```

The team keeps editing the document where it already lives, and the instruction reaches every new session in the channel.
A team that wants each change reviewed as a pull request can keep its runbook as a skill in a [skills repository](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/skills-repo), a git repository an Owner registers and attaches to the channel; a merged pull request syncs the update to your organization automatically, and anyone in the channel can ask Claude to draft that pull request.
When an answer changes, update the runbook where it lives. Edit the document, edit and save the **Channel instructions** field, or merge a pull request in the repository. However you ship the update, check the changed answer in a fresh thread. A thread already underway keeps the instructions and skills it started with.
