Each use case below links to a page with prompts to paste, what it needs connected, and how to set it up to [run on a schedule or watch the channel](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/proactivity) instead of asking each time.

If typing `@Claude` doesn’t show **Claude** with an **APP** badge, the Claude app isn’t installed in your Slack workspace; ask your Slack admin to install it. If the mention sends but Claude doesn’t reply, ask your Claude organization admin to enable Claude Tag for the channel and send them the [setup guide](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview).
