Connecting Stripe lets Claude answer billing and subscription questions in any channel where the connector is on. Claude connects with its own credential, not a person’s.
Pair this connector with the Stripe plugin from Anthropic’s plugin marketplace so Claude knows how to call the API. Add the plugin on the [**Skills and plugins**](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag?access=plugins) tab. This connector calls Stripe’s HTTP API. It isn’t an MCP server or a member’s personal claude.ai connector.

##  Create the credential in Stripe

Use a restricted key with read-only resource permissions, not your account’s full secret key. Consider connecting test mode first.
Stripe’s own guide for creating the credential is at [docs.stripe.com](https://docs.stripe.com/keys).

##  Add the connector

Go to [**Organization settings > Claude Tag > Connectors**](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag?access=connectors), click **Add**, and select **Stripe**. Fill in these fields in the connect form.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Claude’s secret key | The secret key from Stripe |
| Allowed websites | `api.stripe.com` (preset) |

The field labeled Claude’s secret key accepts a restricted key; the label is the field name, not a key-type constraint.
The first credential you add for a service from the **Connectors** tab is on in every workspace and channel as soon as you save it. To give it narrower reach, see [where a new connector applies](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/admins/add-connections#add-a-connection) before you save the connector. Click **Connect** to save the connector.
The Agent Proxy injects the credential at the network boundary; the model and the sandbox are not given the key. See [how Agent Proxy works](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/concepts/agent-identity#agent-proxy).

##  Verify the connection

In a channel where the connector is on, in a new thread:

```
@Claude what can you access from this channel?
```

Stripe appears in the list once the connector is live. New threads pick up the connector on their own; in an existing thread, ask Claude to use the service by name.
