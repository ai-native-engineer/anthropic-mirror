    Filter remote sessions created before this time (RFC 3339 format)

    format: date-time

  - `lte: optional string`

    Filter remote sessions created at or before this time (RFC 3339 format)

    format: date-time

- `limit: optional number`

  Maximum results (default: 100, max: 500)

  default: 100, maximum: 500, minimum: 1

- `organization_ids: optional array of string`

  Filter to specific child organization identifiers. Omit to enumerate every child organization the key may read.

  maxItems: 500

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque pagination token from a previous response's `next_page` field. Pass this to retrieve the next page of results. Clients should treat this value as an opaque string and not attempt to parse or interpret its contents, as the format may change without notice.

- `user_ids: optional array of string`

  Filter to sessions owned by specific users (max 10 per request). Agent-owned sessions are excluded when this filter is set.

  maxItems: 10

#### Headers

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

#### Returns

- `data: array of object`

  - `id: string`

    Remote session identifier

  - `agent_id: string or null`

    Identifier of the automated agent that owns the session. Null for user-owned sessions. At most one of `user` and `agent_id` is set.

  - `claude_project_id: string or null`

    ID of the project the session is bound to. Null when the session has no project binding.

  - `created_at: string`

    When the session was created (RFC 3339, UTC)

    format: date-time

  - `organization_uuid: string`

    UUID of the organization the session belongs to

  - `product_surface: string or null`

    The Claude product the session was created from. Currently `cowork_remote`, for Cowork sessions started on claude.ai web or mobile. More values will appear as other surfaces launch, so treat any unrecognized value as an unclassified surface rather than an error. Null for sessions created before this field was recorded, for surfaces that do not stamp it, and for unrecognized tag values.

  - `started_by_user: object or null`

    A user associated with a remote session.

    - `id: string`

      User identifier

    - `email_address: string or null`

      User's email address. Null when the user is no longer a member of an organization the key may read — `id` remains set so attribution is preserved. The messages endpoint does not resolve email addresses; this field is always null there.

  - `status: string`

    Session lifecycle state. One of `active`, `paused`, `archived`, or `failed` — the lifecycle states the owning product surface exposes — plus `pending`, a brief transient state that resolves before any transcript content exists. The list endpoint includes `pending`; the messages endpoint returns 404 for it. Deleted sessions are not returned on either endpoint. Treat unrecognized values as an unknown state rather than an error.

  - `updated_at: string`

    When the session was last modified (RFC 3339, UTC)

    format: date-time

  - `user: object or null`

    A user associated with a remote session.

    - `id: string`

      User identifier

    - `email_address: string or null`

      User's email address. Null when the user is no longer a member of an organization the key may read — `id` remains set so attribution is preserved. The messages endpoint does not resolve email addresses; this field is always null there.

- `next_page: string or null`

  Opaque page token; pass as `page` to retrieve the next page. Null when no rows exist after this page. Treat this value as opaque; do not parse or store it long-term, as the format may change without notice.

#### Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/apps/sessions/remote \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_API_KEY"

## Compliance API › Apps › Sessions › Remote › Messages

### Retrieve remote session messages

**GET** `/v1/compliance/apps/sessions/remote/{claude_remote_session_id}/messages`

Retrieve one remote session's transcript: user prompts, assistant
responses, and tool calls and results. Thinking blocks and images are
not included.

Messages are returned oldest first by default; pass `order=desc` to
reverse. Pagination uses the same `page`/`next_page` scheme as the
list endpoint, with at most `limit` messages per page (default 100,
maximum 1000); keep paginating until `next_page` is null.
`tool_use_input_max_bytes` and `tool_result_max_bytes` cap how many
bytes of each tool-use input and each tool-result text item are
returned; a block shortened by either cap carries `truncated: true`.

The response embeds the session's metadata under `session` alongside
the paginated `data` array. On this endpoint `session.user.email_address`
and `session.started_by_user` are always null; read them from the list
endpoint instead.

Returns 404 while the session is still `pending`, for deleted sessions,
and for sessions outside the organizations the key may read. A
malformed session identifier returns 400.

#### Path parameters

- `claude_remote_session_id: string`

  The remote session identifier (`cse_...`) to retrieve

#### Query parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Maximum results (default: 100, max: 1000)

  default: 100, maximum: 1000, minimum: 1

- `order: optional "asc" or "desc"`

  Sort direction. `asc` (oldest-first) or `desc`.

  default: asc

  - `"asc"`

  - `"desc"`

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque pagination token from a previous response's `next_page` field. Pass this to retrieve the next page of results. Clients should treat this value as an opaque string and not attempt to parse or interpret its contents, as the format may change without notice.

- `tool_result_max_bytes: optional number`

  Truncate each text item inside a tool result to at most this many bytes (cut on a code-point boundary). Pass `-1` to request the server maximum. `0` is not a valid value.

  default: 10000, maximum: 2147483647, minimum: -1

- `tool_use_input_max_bytes: optional number`

  Truncate each tool-use input to at most this many bytes (cut on a code-point boundary so the result is valid UTF-8). Pass `-1` to request the server maximum. `0` is not a valid value.

  default: 10000, maximum: 2147483647, minimum: -1

#### Headers

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

#### Returns

- `data: array of object`

  Transcript turns for this page, ordered by transcript position. `created_at` is a commit timestamp and may tie or invert under concurrent writes; do not re-sort by it.

  - `id: string`

    Unique identifier for the message, e.g. `csev_abc123`

  - `content: array of object or object or object`

    Content blocks within the message

    - `Text object`

      Text content block.

      - `text: string`

        Text content from the user or the assistant

      - `truncated: boolean`

        True when `text` exceeded the server-defined maximum (approximately 1 MiB) and was shortened.

        default: false

      - `type: "text"`

        default: text

    - `ToolUse object`

      Tool invocation requested by the assistant.

      - `id: string or null`

        Tool-use ID, e.g. 'toolu_01AbC...'

      - `input: string`

        Arguments passed to the tool, as a JSON-encoded string. May be shortened — see the `truncated` field

      - `name: string`

        Name of the tool invoked

      - `truncated: boolean`

        True when `input` was shortened. Pass `tool_use_input_max_bytes=-1` to request full content, subject to the server-side maximum.

        default: false

      - `type: "tool_use"`

        default: tool_use

    - `ToolResult object`

      Result returned by a tool invocation.

      - `content: array of object`

        Text content returned by the tool. Non-text item types are omitted.

        - `text: string`

          Text returned by the tool

        - `type: "text"`

      - `is_error: boolean`

        True when the tool reported an error

      - `name: string`

        Name of the tool that produced this result

      - `tool_use_id: string or null`

        ID of the tool_use block this result responds to

      - `truncated: boolean`

        True when one or more text items in `content` were shortened. Pass `tool_result_max_bytes=-1` to request full content, subject to the server-side maximum.

        default: false

      - `type: "tool_result"`

        default: tool_result

  - `content_unavailable: boolean`

    True when the stored content could not be returned — it could not be decrypted, or it exceeded the server's per-event size bound. `content` is empty in that case; this distinguishes 'no content' from 'content withheld'.

    default: false

  - `created_at: string`

    When the message was recorded (RFC 3339, UTC)

    format: date-time

  - `role: "assistant" or "user"`

## Compliance API › Code › Artifacts

### List Code Artifacts

**GET** `/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts`

List Claude Code Artifacts owned by organizations under the parent
organization.

Results are sorted by Artifact identifier. Pages may be short or empty
while `next_page` is still set — continue until `next_page` is absent.
Artifacts are sorted by identifier (not creation time): an Artifact
published during an export may land before the cursor and be omitted, so
for a point-in-time-complete export re-enumerate after publishing
quiesces.

Artifacts owned by a since-deleted child organization are not
returned.

#### Query parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Maximum results (default: 20, max: 100)

  default: 20, maximum: 100, minimum: 1

- `organization_ids: optional array of string`

  Filter by organization IDs (accepts `org_...` or organization UUID, up to 500). Enumerate IDs via `GET /v1/compliance/organizations`.

  maxItems: 500

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque pagination token from a previous response's `next_page` field. Pass this to retrieve the next page of results. Clients should treat this value as an opaque string and not attempt to parse or interpret its contents, as the format may change without notice.

- `updated_at: optional object`

  - `gt: optional string`

    Return only Artifacts updated after this time (RFC 3339 format). See `updated_at.gte` for the completeness caveat.

    format: date-time

  - `gte: optional string`

    Return only Artifacts updated at or after this time (RFC 3339 format). Time filters match an eventually-consistent index and Artifacts published before this field was recorded never match — omit the time filter for compliance-complete enumeration. For incremental export, apply a generous overlap margin between windows and dedupe by `id`: adjacent tiling silently misses items whose index update lagged their publish.

    format: date-time

  - `lt: optional string`

    Return only Artifacts updated before this time (RFC 3339 format). Multiple time operators are AND-ed to the tightest bound. See `updated_at.gte` for the completeness caveat.

    format: date-time

  - `lte: optional string`

    Return only Artifacts updated at or before this time (RFC 3339 format). See `updated_at.gte` for the completeness caveat.

    format: date-time

- `user_ids: optional array of string`

  Filter by owner user IDs (up to 200). Enumerate IDs via `GET /v1/compliance/organizations/{org_uuid}/users`.

  maxItems: 200

#### Headers

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

#### Returns

- `data: array of object`

  Page of Artifacts

  - `id: string`

    Artifact identifier (tagged ID)

  - `organization_uuid: string`

    Organization UUID this Artifact belongs to

  - `owner_user_id: string or null`

    Artifact owner's user identifier (tagged ID), or null for Artifacts published by an agent session rather than a user account. When set, it survives after the owner's account is deleted or the owner leaves every organization under the parent.

  - `published_version_id: string or null`

    Identifier of the version a non-owner viewer would render when `read_mode` permits them — the version the owner has pinned for non-owner readers if one is pinned, otherwise the owner's latest. When `read_mode` is `owner` no non-owner renders any version; the field still reports which version would be served were read_mode widened.

  - `read_mode: "org" or "owner" or "public" or "users"`

    Who can view this Artifact: only its owner, a named set of users, every member of its organization, or anyone on the internet (`public`)

    - `"org"`

    - `"owner"`

    - `"public"`

    - `"users"`

  - `updated_at: string or null`

    Artifact last update timestamp, or null for Artifacts published before this field was recorded

    format: date-time

  - `user: object or null`

    The user who owns a Code Artifact.

    Fields that reference this type are null when the Artifact was
    published by an agent session rather than a user account, when the
    owner's account has been deleted, or when the owner is no longer a
    member of an organization the key may read.

    - `id: string`

      User identifier (tagged ID)

    - `email_address: string`

      User's email address

  - `versions: array of object`

    Up to roughly 20 most-recently-published versions of this Artifact (older versions are not retained). Metadata only — use `GET /v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/{artifact_id}/versions/{version_id}` to download a version's content.

    - `id: string`

      Opaque version identifier

    - `created_at: string or null`

      When this version was published

      format: date-time

    - `name: string`

      Artifact title at this version. Falls back to the version identifier when the title for an older version is no longer retained.

- `has_more: boolean`

  Whether `next_page` is set. May be true for a page whose next page is empty — continue until `next_page` is absent.

- `next_page: string or null`

  Token to retrieve the next page. Use this as the 'page' parameter in your next request

#### Example

```bash

### Download Code Artifact Version Content

**GET** `/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/{artifact_id}/versions/{version_id}`

Streams the content of one version of a Claude Code Artifact as the
response body.

Returns 404 for Artifacts that don't exist or belong to another parent
organization. A listed version id can start returning 404 if subsequent
publishes rotated it out of retained history — re-list on 404. Returns
503 while the version's content upload is
still in flight or was abandoned — retry with backoff. Oversized
encoded content aborts mid-stream: headers and initial bytes arrive
but the body terminates early — an aborted chunked transfer is the
only truncation signal for encoded content. `Content-MD5` is emitted
only for identity-stored content; validate against it when present.

#### Path parameters

- `artifact_id: string`

  The Artifact ID (tagged ID, e.g., cart_abc123)

- `version_id: string`

  Opaque version identifier from the Artifact's `versions` list

#### Headers

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

#### Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/$ARTIFACT_ID/versions/$VERSION_ID \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_API_KEY"
```

### Delete Code Artifact

**DELETE** `/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/{artifact_id}`

Permanently deletes a Code Artifact and all its versions. This is a
destructive operation that cannot be undone. A 200 response means the
deletion is initiated and the Artifact is claimed; content removal
completes asynchronously.

Returns 404 for Artifacts that don't exist or belong to another parent
organization. Returns 404 on a repeated delete of an already-deleted
Artifact.

#### Path parameters

- `artifact_id: string`

  The Artifact ID (tagged ID, e.g., cart_abc123)

#### Headers

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

#### Returns

- `id: string`

  The ID of the Artifact that was deleted

- `type: "code_artifact_deleted"`

  Constant string confirming deletion

  default: code_artifact_deleted

#### Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/$ARTIFACT_ID \
    -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_API_KEY"
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "id": "cart_xyz789",
  "type": "code_artifact_deleted"
}
```
