    referenced key. Create key configurations with the External Keys API. On
    Claude Platform on AWS the value is the AWS KMS key ARN, and the key must be a
    single-Region key in the same AWS account and Region as the Workspace. On that

### Get Workspace

`beta.organization.workspaces.retrieve(workspace_id)  -> BetaWorkspace`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}`

Get Workspace

#### Parameters

- `workspace_id: str`

  ID of the Workspace.

#### Returns

- `class BetaWorkspace: …`

  - `id: str`

    ID of the Workspace.

  - `archived_at: Optional[datetime]`

    format: date-time

  - `compartment_id: str`

    Identifier for this Workspace's encryption compartment. When you configure a
    customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) on AWS, reference this value in your
    KMS key-policy condition so the key is scoped to this compartment. On GCP and
    Azure, Anthropic enforces the compartment binding automatically; you do not
    need to reference this value in your key configuration. See the CMEK
    integration guide for the required key configuration; unless your organization
    is on Claude Platform on AWS, it includes a separate value used during key
    validation. On Claude Platform on AWS there is no separate validation value:
    the key is validated against this Workspace's own value when it is attached, so
    if your key policy uses the compartment condition, add this value to it before
    attaching the key.

  - `created_at: datetime`

    RFC 3339 datetime string indicating when the Workspace was created.

    format: date-time

      - `List[str]`

      - `Literal["unrestricted"]`

    - `default_inference_geo: str`

      Default inference geo applied when requests omit the parameter.

    - `workspace_geo: str`

      Geographic region for workspace data storage. Immutable after creation.

  - `display_color: str`

    Hex color code representing the Workspace in the Anthropic Console.

  - `external_key_id: Optional[str]`

    ID of the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) configuration to use for this
    Workspace. Setting this field requires CMEK to be enabled for your
    organization. When set, data stored for this Workspace is encrypted with the
    referenced key. Create key configurations with the External Keys API. On

## Beta › Organization › Workspaces › Rate Limits

### List Workspace Rate Limits

`beta.organization.workspaces.rate_limits.list(workspace_id, **kwargs)  -> SyncPageCursor[BetaWorkspaceRateLimit]`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/rate_limits`

List rate-limit overrides configured for a workspace.

Returns only the groups and limiter types that have a workspace-level
override. Groups without overrides inherit the organization limits and
are not listed; use `GET /v1/organizations/rate_limits` to see those.

When `limit` is omitted, every matching entry is returned in a single
page; when `limit` truncates the result, follow `next_page` to fetch
the remaining entries.

#### Parameters

- `workspace_id: str`

  The ID of the workspace.

- `group_type: Optional[Literal["batch", "files", "model_group", 3 more]]`

  Filter by group type.

  - `"batch"`

  - `"files"`

  - `"model_group"`

  - `"skills"`

  - `"token_count"`

  - `"web_search"`

- `limit: Optional[int]`

  Maximum number of items to return per page. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.

  When omitted, every remaining entry is returned in a single page and `next_page` is `null`.

  maximum: 1000, minimum: 1

- `page: Optional[str]`

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

#### Returns

- `class BetaWorkspaceRateLimit: …`

  - `group_type: Literal["batch", "files", "model_group", 3 more]`

    The kind of rate-limit group this entry represents. `model_group` entries apply to a family of models (listed in `models`); other values apply to an API-surface category and have `models` set to `null`.

    - `"batch"`

    - `"files"`

    - `"model_group"`

    - `"skills"`

    - `"token_count"`

    - `"web_search"`

  - `limits: List[BetaWorkspaceRateLimitValue]`

    The limiter values overridden for this group in this workspace. Limiter types without a workspace override are omitted and inherit the organization value.

    - `org_limit: Optional[int]`

      The organization-level value for the same limiter type, for reference. `null` when the organization has no limit configured for this limiter type.

    - `type: str`

      The limiter type (for example, `requests_per_minute` or `input_tokens_per_minute`).

    - `value: int`

      The workspace-level override value for this limiter type.

  - `models: Optional[List[str]]`

    Model names this entry's limits apply to, including aliases. `null` when `group_type` is not `"model_group"`.

  - `rate_limit_id: str`

    The `id` of the RateLimit group this override applies to.

  - `type: Literal["workspace_rate_limit"]`

    Object type. Always `workspace_rate_limit` for workspace rate-limit entries.

    default: workspace_rate_limit

  - `workspace_id: str`

    ID of the Workspace this override applies to.

#### Example

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"

## Beta › Organization › Workspaces › Service Accounts

### List Service Account Workspace Members

`beta.organization.workspaces.service_accounts.list(workspace_id, **kwargs)  -> SyncPageCursor[BetaServiceAccountWorkspaceMember]`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`

List the service accounts that are members of a workspace.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role`. Use `limit`
and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. Archived workspaces return 400;
use `GET /service_accounts/{id}/workspaces` to audit memberships of an
archived workspace. The implicit default-workspace membership is not
included in this list. Memberships of archived service accounts are
omitted from the results.

#### Parameters

- `workspace_id: str`

  ID of the workspace.

- `limit: Optional[int]`

  Number of results per page.

  default: 20, maximum: 100, minimum: 1

### Create Service Account Workspace Member

`beta.organization.workspaces.service_accounts.add(workspace_id, **kwargs)  -> BetaServiceAccountWorkspaceMember`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api).

Add a service account to a workspace with the given `workspace_role`.

The role determines what the service account can do in the workspace and
which workspace-scoped permissions it can be granted when authenticating
through federation. Every service account is already an implicit
`workspace_user` member of the default workspace; adding it explicitly
assigns a chosen role. If the service account is already an explicit
member of the workspace, its `workspace_role` is replaced with the
value supplied here. Archived workspaces return 400. Archived service
accounts cannot be added and are rejected.

#### Parameters

- `workspace_id: str`

  ID of the workspace.

- `service_account_id: str`

  Tagged service account ID to add.

- `workspace_role: BetaNoBillingWorkspaceRole`

  Role to assign to the service account in this workspace.

    True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

  - `service_account_id: str`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

  - `type: Literal["service_account_workspace_member"]`

    default: service_account_workspace_member

  - `workspace_id: str`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
beta_service_account_workspace_member = (
    client.beta.organization.workspaces.service_accounts.update(
        service_account_id="service_account_id",
        workspace_id="workspace_id",
        workspace_role="workspace_admin",
    )
)
print(beta_service_account_workspace_member.created_by_actor_id)
```

##### Response (200)

}
```

### Delete Service Account Workspace Member

`beta.organization.workspaces.service_accounts.remove(service_account_id, **kwargs)  -> ServiceAccountRemoveResponse`

**DELETE** `/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api).

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Removal is idempotent (returns 200 even if the membership was already
removed). A DELETE against the implicit default-workspace membership
returns 200 but is a no-op and the membership persists; deleting an
explicit default-workspace row reverts to the implicit `workspace_user`
membership. Archived workspaces return 400.

#### Parameters

- `workspace_id: str`

  ID of the workspace.

- `service_account_id: str`

  ID of the service account.

- `betas: Optional[List[AnthropicBetaParam]]`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  - `str`

## Beta › Organization › Rate Limits

### List Organization Rate Limits

`beta.organization.rate_limits.list(**kwargs)  -> SyncPageCursor[BetaOrganizationRateLimit]`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/rate_limits`

List Messages API rate limits for your organization.

Each entry corresponds to one rate-limit group (either a model family
or an API-surface category such as the Files API or Message Batches)
and contains the set of limiter values that apply to it.

When `limit` is omitted, every matching entry is returned in a single
page; when `limit` truncates the result, follow `next_page` to fetch
the remaining entries.

#### Parameters

- `group_type: Optional[Literal["batch", "files", "model_group", 3 more]]`

  Filter by group type.

  - `"batch"`

  - `"files"`

  - `"model_group"`

  - `"skills"`

  - `"token_count"`

  - `"web_search"`

- `limit: Optional[int]`

  Maximum number of items to return per page. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.

  When omitted, every remaining entry is returned in a single page and `next_page` is `null`.

  maximum: 1000, minimum: 1

- `model: Optional[str]`

  Filter to the single entry containing this model. Accepts full model names and aliases. Returns 404 if the model is not found or has no rate limits for this organization.

- `page: Optional[str]`

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

#### Returns

- `class BetaOrganizationRateLimit: …`

  - `id: str`

    Stable identifier for this rate-limit group within the organization.

  - `group_type: Literal["batch", "files", "model_group", 3 more]`

    The kind of rate-limit group this entry represents. `model_group` entries apply to a family of models (listed in `models`); other values apply to an API-surface category and have `models` set to `null`.

    - `"batch"`

    - `"files"`

    - `"model_group"`

    - `"skills"`

    - `"token_count"`

    - `"web_search"`

  - `limits: List[BetaOrganizationRateLimitValue]`

    The limiter values that apply to this group.

    - `type: str`

      The limiter type (for example, `requests_per_minute` or `input_tokens_per_minute`).

    - `value: int`

      The configured limit value for this limiter type.

  - `models: Optional[List[str]]`

    Model names this entry's limits apply to, including aliases. `null` when `group_type` is not `"model_group"`.

  - `type: Literal["rate_limit"]`

    Object type. Always `rate_limit` for organization rate-limit entries.

    default: rate_limit

#### Example

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
page = client.beta.organization.rate_limits.list()
page = page.data[0]
print(page.id)
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "id",
      "group_type": "batch",
      "limits": [
        {
          "type": "type",
          "value": 0
        }
      ],
      "models": [

## Beta › Organization › Compliance Settings

### Get Compliance Settings

`beta.organization.compliance_settings.retrieve()  -> BetaComplianceSettings`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/compliance_settings`

Retrieve your organization's Compliance Settings.

Compliance Settings is a singleton resource: there is exactly one per
organization, addressed without an identifier. The `state` field reflects
whether the Compliance API is enabled. An organization with a parent
organization reads the state inherited from the parent's configuration.

#### Returns

- `class BetaComplianceSettings: …`

  - `state: State`

    Whether the Compliance API is enabled for this organization.

    - `class BetaComplianceSettingsStateEnabled: …`

      - `type: Literal["enabled"]`

        default: enabled

    - `class BetaComplianceSettingsStateDisabled: …`

      - `type: Literal["disabled"]`

        default: disabled

  - `type: Literal["compliance_settings"]`

    default: compliance_settings

#### Example

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
beta_compliance_settings = client.beta.organization.compliance_settings.retrieve()
print(beta_compliance_settings.state)
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "state": {
    "type": "enabled"
  },
  "type": "compliance_settings"
}
```

### Update Compliance Settings

`beta.organization.compliance_settings.update(**kwargs)  -> BetaComplianceSettings`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/compliance_settings`

Update your organization's Compliance Settings.

Setting `state` to `enabled` turns on the Compliance API and begins
capturing organization activity events. Setting it to `disabled` turns
both off. `state` reflects whether the Compliance API is enabled.

A request that sets `state` to its current value succeeds and leaves the
resource unchanged. A `disabled` request stays in effect until a later
`enabled` request or the organization's next provisioning action that
enables Access Transparency: enabling Access Transparency also enables
the Compliance API, which serves its activity events, so such
provisioning (including re-runs) re-enables the Compliance API even
after a `disabled` request. Automated provisioning never disables
compliance settings.

#### Parameters

- `state: State`

  Desired state. Accepts the string shorthand "enabled" or "disabled" in place of the object form; the response always returns the canonical object form.

  - `class BetaComplianceSettingsStateEnabledParam: …`

    - `type: Literal["enabled"]`

  - `class BetaComplianceSettingsStateDisabledParam: …`

    - `type: Literal["disabled"]`

#### Returns

- `class BetaComplianceSettings: …`

  - `state: State`

    Whether the Compliance API is enabled for this organization.

    - `class BetaComplianceSettingsStateEnabled: …`

      - `type: Literal["enabled"]`

        default: enabled

    - `class BetaComplianceSettingsStateDisabled: …`

      - `type: Literal["disabled"]`

        default: disabled

  - `type: Literal["compliance_settings"]`

    default: compliance_settings

#### Example

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
beta_compliance_settings = client.beta.organization.compliance_settings.update(
    state={"type": "enabled"},
)
print(beta_compliance_settings.state)
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "state": {
    "type": "enabled"
  },
  "type": "compliance_settings"
}
```
