# Stop Work
POST/v1/environments/{environment_id}/work/{work_id}/stop
Note: these endpoints are called automatically by the pre-built environment worker provided in the SDKs and CLI, for orchestrating sessions with self-hosted sandbox environments. They are included here as a reference; you do not need to invoke them directly.
