# Parallel tool use
Enable and format parallel tool calls, with message-history guidance and troubleshooting.
This page covers parallel tool calls: when Claude calls multiple tools in one turn, how to format the message history so parallelism keeps working, and how to disable it. For the single-call flow, see [Handle tool calls](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/handle-tool-calls).
By default, Claude may use multiple tools to answer a user query. You can disable this behavior by:
  * Setting `disable_parallel_tool_use=true` when `tool_choice` type is `auto`, which ensures that Claude uses **at most one** tool
  * Setting `disable_parallel_tool_use=true` when `tool_choice` type is `any` or `tool`, which ensures that Claude uses **exactly one** tool

Execution semantics
When Claude returns multiple `tool_use` blocks in a single assistant turn, how you run them is your decision. The API doesn't prescribe an execution order: you can run the calls concurrently (`Promise.all`, `asyncio.gather`), sequentially in the order they appear, or in any combination that suits your tools.
Choose the strategy based on what your tools do. Independent, read-only operations are usually safe to run in parallel for lower latency. Tools with side effects, shared state, or ordering requirements might be better run sequentially.
Whichever strategy you use, return one `tool_result` for each `tool_use` block, all together in the next user message. If you choose not to run a particular call (for example, because you ran the batch sequentially and an earlier call failed), still return a `tool_result` for it with `is_error: true` and a brief explanation.

  "type": "tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_02",
  "is_error": true,
  "content": "Not executed: the preceding write_file call failed."

Worked example
**Simpler with Tool Runner** : The example below shows manual parallel tool handling. For most use cases, [Tool Runner](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-runner) automatically handles parallel tool execution with much less code.
Here's a complete, runnable script to test and verify parallel tool calls are working correctly:

  * How to verify that parallel calls are being made
  * The correct message structure that encourages future parallel tool use
  * Common mistakes to avoid (like text before tool results)

Run this script to test your implementation and ensure Claude is making parallel tool calls effectively.
Maximizing parallel tool use
While Claude 4 models have excellent parallel tool use capabilities by default, you can increase the likelihood of parallel tool execution across all models with targeted prompting:
### System prompts for parallel tool use
### User message prompting
Troubleshooting
If Claude isn't making parallel tool calls when expected, check these common issues:
**1. Incorrect tool result formatting**
The most common issue is formatting tool results incorrectly in the conversation history. This "teaches" Claude to avoid parallel calls.
Specifically for parallel tool use:
  * ❌ **Wrong** : Sending separate user messages for each tool result
  * ✅ **Correct** : All tool results must be in a single user message

// ❌ This reduces parallel tool use
[
  {"role": "assistant", "content": [tool_use_1, tool_use_2]},
  {"role": "user", "content": [tool_result_1]},
  {"role": "user", "content": [tool_result_2]}  // Separate message
]

// ✅ This maintains parallel tool use
[
  {"role": "assistant", "content": [tool_use_1, tool_use_2]},
  {"role": "user", "content": [tool_result_1, tool_result_2]}  // Single message
]

See [Handle tool calls](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/handle-tool-calls) for other formatting rules.
**2. Weak prompting**
Default prompting may not be sufficient. Use the stronger system prompt from the [Maximizing parallel tool use](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/parallel-tool-use#maximizing-parallel-tool-use) section above.
**3. Measuring parallel tool usage**
To verify parallel tool calls are working:

# Calculate average tools per tool-calling message
tool_call_messages = [
    msg for msg in messages if any(block.type == "tool_use" for block in msg.content)
]
total_tool_calls = sum(
    len([b for b in msg.content if b.type == "tool_use"]) for msg in tool_call_messages
)
avg_tools_per_message = (
    total_tool_calls / len(tool_call_messages) if tool_call_messages else 0.0
)
print(f"Average tools per message: {avg_tools_per_message}")
# Should be > 1.0 if parallel calls are working

**4. Calls in a batch appear to depend on each other**
Execution order is your choice. If your tools have ordering dependencies, running the batch sequentially and stopping on the first failure is a valid strategy: return `is_error: true` for any call you didn't run. If you run in parallel and a call fails because its prerequisite hadn't completed, return `is_error: true` with the natural error message; Claude will reissue it on the next turn. To reduce dependent calls appearing together, add this to your system prompt: "Only batch tool calls that are independent of each other."
