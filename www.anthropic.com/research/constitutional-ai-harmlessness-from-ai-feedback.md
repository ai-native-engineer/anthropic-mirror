# Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI feedback

## Abstract

As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.

### Formalizing Fermat's Last Theorem

We are sharing the first complete computer-checked proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. Claude worked largely autonomously over 11 days to write the proof in the Lean programming language. Below, we describe how the formalization was done and share some thoughts about what this work could mean for research mathematics.

### Automated researchers can reliably mitigate alignment failures

We had Claude autonomously train models to improve their performance on several public benchmarks that measure 10 categories of alignment failure. For all 10, Claude found fixes that improved the target benchmarks without degrading capabilities.

### Enabling independent research on how people use Claude

Earlier this year, we ran a pilot giving external researchers access to aggregate, real-world Claude usage data. Three research groups designed their own studies for Anthropic Insights, our privacy-preserving analysis tool. In this post, we share high-level results from those studies and what we learned running this pilot.
