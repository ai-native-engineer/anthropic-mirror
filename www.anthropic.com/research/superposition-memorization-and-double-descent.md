# Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent

## Abstract

In a [recent paper](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html), we found that simple neural networks trained on toy tasks often exhibit a phenomenon called superposition, where they represent more features than they have neurons. Our investigation was limited to the infinite-data, underfitting regime. But there's reason to believe that understanding overfitting might be important if we want to succeed at mechanistic interpretability, and that superposition might be a central part of the story.

Why should mechanistic interpretability care about overfitting? Despite overfitting being a central problem in machine learning, we have little mechanistic understanding of what exactly is going on when deep learning models overfit or memorize examples. Additionally, previous work has hinted that there may be an important link between overfitting and learning interpretable features.

So understanding overfitting is important, but why should it be relevant to superposition? Consider the case of a language model which verbatim memorizes text. How can it do this? One naive idea is that it might use neurons to create a lookup table mapping sequences to arbitrary continuations. For every sequence of tokens it wishes to memorize, it could dedicate one neuron to detecting that sequence, and then implement arbitrary behavior when it fires. The problem with this approach is that it's extremely inefficient – but it seems like a perfect candidate for superposition, since each case is mutually exclusive and can't interfere.

In this note, we offer a very preliminary investigation of training the same toy models in our previous paper on limited datasets. Despite being extremely simple, the toy model turns out to be a surprisingly rich case study for overfitting. In particular, we find the following:

* Overfitting corresponds to storing data points, rather than features, in superposition.
* Depending on dataset size, our models fall into two different regimes: an overfitting regime (characterized by storing data points in superposition), and a generalizing regime (characterized by storing features in superposition).
* We observe double descent as the model transitions between these regimes.

### How Claude is accelerating protein design and analytical chemistry

In this post, we share two results that show how Claude can help life scientists increase the pace of their research. In the first, we tested Claude’s ability to design protein binders from scratch, a key step in creating protein-based drugs that has historically taken a specialist weeks or months per target. In the second example, we evaluated whether Claude can accelerate chemical analysis. Claude Opus 5, a generally available model, was given NMR and LC-MS data (the data that allows chemists to assess the identity and purity of the compounds they work with).

### Patterns and problems in emerging multiagent systems

Here, we identify a few examples of behavioral tendencies in current frontier models and show how they can produce unexpected systemic failures, in hopes of starting a conversation about mitigating these risks.

### Reviewing the evidence on worker retraining programs

We're sharing a review of the evidence on worker retraining programs, coauthored by independent researcher David Roodman and Anthropic's Maxim Massenkoff.
