## Abstract

In this paper, we report an architectural change which appears to substantially increase the fraction of MLP neurons which appear to be "interpretable" (i.e. respond to an articulable property of the input), at little to no cost to ML performance. Specifically, we replace the activation function with a softmax linear unit (which we term SoLU) and show that this significantly increases the fraction of neurons in the MLP layers which seem to correspond to readily human-understandable concepts, phrases, or categories on quick investigation, as measured by randomized and blinded experiments. We then study our SoLU models and use them to gain several new insights about how information is processed in transformers. However, we also discover some evidence that the superposition hypothesis is true and there is no free lunch: SoLU may be making some features more interpretable by “hiding” others and thus making them even more deeply uninterpretable. Despite this, SoLU still seems like a net win, as in practical terms it substantially increases the fraction of neurons we are able to understand.

### How Claude is uplifting biomolecular modeling

Claude made the open-source models that scientists use to predict and design biomolecules faster and more memory-efficient. Claude optimized more than 30 of these models in just under four weeks, speeding them up roughly 4x on average. It also created a low-memory mode that enables the accurate prediction of biomolecular systems larger than 10,000 tokens (amino acids, nucleotides, and atoms from small molecules and ions) on a single NVIDIA GPU node.
